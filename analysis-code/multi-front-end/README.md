# PyComply: Python compliance analysis


Welcome to PyComply!

All the action here takes place in the
[Makefile](./Makefile).

Essentially, you specify the version of PyComply that you want to
build, and the relevant parser and scanner are then generated and
built.

We use flex and bison to do this, and the relevant sources, version-by-version, are in the
[scanners](./scanners)
and
[parsers](./parsers)
folders.
