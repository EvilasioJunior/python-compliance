## The non-2.7 applications

These are the syntax error logs for the applications that showed a
significant failure rate for PyComply 2.7 (but passed PyComply 3.x).

These are:
* the Qualitas applications django and ipython,
* home-assistant from the GitHub top 20, and
* a copy of the Python 3.6 library that is distributed with SciPy.
